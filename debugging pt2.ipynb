      "Verified Observations:\n",
      "\n",
      "Observation: **Color Addition**: The transformation introduces additional colors (yellow and red) not present in the input grid, indicating that the output grid incorporates new elements or rules that allow for color expansion.\n",
      "Valid: False\n",
      "\n",
      "Observation: **Volume Increase**: The number of colored cells increases in the transformation, suggesting a process that not only redistributes but also amplifies the presence of colored elements.\n",
      "Valid: True\n",
      "\n",
      "Observation: **Boundary Consistency**: The external grid dimensions remain unchanged throughout the transformation process, emphasizing that all changes occur internally. This boundary integrity suggests a contained transformation methodology rather than a chaotic expansion.\n",
      "Valid: True\n",
      "\n",
      "Observation: **Structural Consistency**: While the patterns change, the overall structure of the grid remains intact, with cells remaining in their original positions but changing colors. This indicates that the transformation operates within the existing grid framework without altering cell positions.\n",
      "Valid: True\n",
      "\n",
      "Observation: **Introduction of New Colors**: The output grid introduces new colors (red, yellow, and light blue), which are not present in the input grid, suggesting that the transformation applies rules that generate new states or colors based on existing patterns.\n",
      "Valid: False\n",
      "\n",
      "Observation: **Retained Elements**: Certain elements from the input grid (like the green and red) are retained in their original positions or slightly modified, indicating a preservation of structural elements through the transformation.\n",
      "Valid: True\n",
      "\n",
      "Observation: **Central Transformation Point**: The input grids consistently feature a central blue square that acts as a focal point for transformation, indicating that changes radiate outwards from this area.\n",
      "Valid: False\n",
      "\n",
      "Observation: **Addition of New Colors**: New colors are introduced in the output grid (e.g., red, yellow) that do not appear in the input grid, suggesting that the transformation rules allow for the creation of new elements.\n",
      "Valid: True\n",
      "\n",
      "Observation: **Spatial Integrity**: Despite the addition of new colors and shapes, the overall dimensions of the grid remain unchanged, which implies the transformation operates within the confines of the existing structure.\n",
      "Valid: True\n",
      "\n",
      "Observation: **Reduction of Gray Areas**: The output grid has fewer gray areas compared to the input grid, which implies that the transformation is focused on enriching the grid with more defined color structures.\n",
      "Valid: False\n",
      "\n",
      "Observation: **Color Introduction**: New colors (red, yellow, green) are introduced in the output grid, which were not present in the input grid, indicating that the transformation not only rearranges existing colors but also adds new elements.\n",
      "Valid: True\n",
      "\n",
      "Observation: **Shift from Sparse to Dense**: The input grid is relatively sparse in color, while the output grid is dense with color presence, indicating a transformation that increases the overall saturation and complexity of the grid.\n",
      "Valid: True\n",
      "\n",
      "Observation: **Consistency in Grid Size**: The dimensions of the grids remain unchanged throughout the transformation, indicating that the transformations are confined within the original boundaries without expanding or contracting the grid.\n",
      "Valid: True\n",
      "\n",
      "Observation: **Color Transformation**: The transformation introduces new colors (like red, yellow, and blue) that were absent in the input grid, indicating that the transformation process involves both color change and addition.\n",
      "Valid: True\n",
      "\n",
      "Observation: **Color Introduction**: New colors (such as yellow and red) emerge in the output grid that were not present in the input grid, suggesting that the transformation process includes color generation or alteration rules beyond mere replication.\n",
      "Valid: True\n",
      "\n",
      "Observation: **Retention of Structure**: Some elements from the input grid (like the gray cells) remain unchanged in the output grid, showing that the transformation selectively enhances certain areas while leaving others intact.\n",
