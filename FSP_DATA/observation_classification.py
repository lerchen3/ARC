            "**Expansion of Dimensions**: Each transformation results in an output grid with larger dimensions, 3 times wider and taller in the examples shown, indicating spatial expansion.",
            "**Color Retention**: The transformation maintains consistent color usage throughout each sequence. Each color present in the initial pattern remains consistent in the final pattern, suggesting that the transformation rules are color-independent.",
            "**Consistent Complexity Increase**: Each transformation increases the complexity in a consistent manner, implying that the rule applied is systematic and could be represented mathematically or algorithmically.",
            "**Zero Dominance**: The black color (represented by 0) occupies a significant portion of the output grids, serving as a background while colored elements are embedded within it to create patterns.",
            "**Pattern Consistency**: The final pattern in each sequence preserves some spatial characteristics of the initial pattern. This suggests that the transformation rule might involve a local duplication or scaling within each block of the original grid.",
            "**Non-linear Distribution**: Transition from the input grids to output grids does not maintain linear uniformity; rather, colors can cluster together or create isolated patches that do not follow a straightforward distribution.",
            "**Selective Surety**: Some colored areas in the input grids are entirely omitted in the output grids, indicating a selective transformation where certain colors or positional instances are favored over others.",
            "**Frequency of Color**: In multiple transformations, certain colors appear more frequently in their respective output grids compared to others. This may suggest a prominence or emphasis on specific hues in the transformed designs.",
            "**Spatial Connectivity**: Some colored regions maintain relative proximity to their positions in the input grids, forming linked patterns like cross shapes or vertical columns in the output grids.",
            "**Transformation Complexity**: The transformations often exhibit complexity in shape; for example, the distinct color patterns within the output grid generate a visual discontinuity relative to the relatively simple input shapes, indicating more intricate design transformations."
