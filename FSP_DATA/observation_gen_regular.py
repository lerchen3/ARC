        "observation": (
            "Here are 10 observations based on the provided transformations between "
            "the input grids and the output grids:\n\n"
            "1. **Expansion of Dimensions**: Each transformation results in an output "
            "grid with larger dimensions (typically 3 times wider and taller in the "
            "examples shown), indicating spatial expansion.\n\n"
            "2. **Color Retention**: The transformation maintains consistent color usage "
            "throughout each sequence. Each color present in the initial pattern remains "
            "consistent in the final pattern, suggesting that the transformation rules "
            "are color-independent.\n\n"
            "3. **Consistent Complexity Increase**: Each transformation increases the complexity "
            "in a consistent manner, implying that the rule applied is systematic and could be "
            "represented mathematically or algorithmically.\n\n"
            "4. **Zero Dominance**: The black color (represented by 0) occupies a "
            "significant portion of the output grids, serving as a background while "
            "colored elements are embedded within it to create patterns.\n\n"
            "5. **Pattern Consistency**: The final pattern in each sequence preserves some "
            "spatial characteristics of the initial pattern. This suggests that the "
            "transformation rule might involve a local duplication or scaling within "
            "each block of the original grid.\n\n"
            "6. **Non-linear Distribution**: Transition from the input grids to output "
            "grids does not maintain linear uniformity; rather, colors can cluster "
            "together or create isolated patches that do not follow a straightforward "
            "distribution.\n\n"
            "7. **Selective Surety**: Some colored areas in the input grids are entirely "
            "omitted in the output grids, indicating a selective transformation where "
            "certain colors or positional instances are favored over others.\n\n"
            "8. **Frequency of Color**: In multiple transformations, certain colors "
            "appear more frequently in their respective output grids compared to "
            "others. This may suggest a prominence or emphasis on specific hues in "
            "the transformed designs.\n\n"
            "9. **Spatial Connectivity**: Some colored regions maintain relative "
            "proximity to their positions in the input grids, forming linked patterns "
            "like cross shapes or vertical columns in the output grids.\n\n"
            "10. **Transformation Complexity**: The transformations often exhibit "
            "complexity in shape; for example, the distinct color patterns within the "
            "output grid generate a visual discontinuity relative to the relatively "
            "simple input shapes, indicating more intricate design transformations."

        "task_id": "212895b5",
        "observations_to_generate": 10,
        "observation": (
            "Here are 10 observations based on the provided transformations between "
            "the input grids and the output grids:\n\n"
            "1. **Grid Dimensions**: Both the input and output grids maintain the same dimensions "
            "in each transformation pair, ensuring that the transformation rules are applied "
            "within a consistent spatial framework.\n\n"
            "2. **Color Consistency**: The set of colors used in the input grids is consistent "
            "with those in the output grids. No new colors are introduced in the transformation "
            "process, which suggests that transformations are restricted to reconfigurations "
            "of existing states (colors).\n\n"
            "3. **Central Focus**: Each transformation sequence begins with a central pattern "
            "surrounded by a mostly unaltered field of gray cells. This central focus then "
            "undergoes a transformation involving color changes and expansions outward.\n\n"
            "4. **Recurrent Colors**: Specific colors (like blue, yellow, red) appear repeatedly "
            "across different transformation scenarios, hinting at standardized roles or "
            "functions for these colors within the transformation rules.\n\n"
            "5. **Symmetry and Patterns**: There is a visible tendency towards creating symmetrical "
            "or patterned arrangements in the output grids, suggesting that the transformation "
            "rules may prioritize or result in organized structures.\n\n"
            "6. **Boundary Integrity**: The boundaries of the grid are unchanged, with "
            "transformations occurring internally without expanding or contracting the grid's "
            "external dimensions.\n\n"
            "7. **No Isolation of Colors**: Colors in the output grids are generally connected "
            "to each other or to cells of the same color, indicating that isolated cells of a "
            "particular color in the output are rare, which may suggest rules about continuity "
            "or clustering.\n\n"
            "8. **Symmetrical Expansion**: The pattern expansion in the final images is symmetrical, "
            "suggesting that the transformation rules apply equally in each direction from the center.\n\n"
            "9. **Pattern Growth**: In all sequences, the central pattern grows into a larger configuration "
            "that includes arms extending diagonally outward. This suggests a rule in the transformation "
            "process that replicates or extends the pattern outward from the center in specific directions.\n\n"
            "10. **Visible Transformation Pathways**: The transformations generally show a "
            "progression or pathway of change, such as a blue cell influencing its immediate "
            "neighbors, which then might transform into red or yellow. This stepwise change "
            "implies a rule set that might mimic diffusion or influence spreading from a point "
            "of origin."
