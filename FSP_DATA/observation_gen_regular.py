            "Here are 10 observations based on the provided transformations between "
            "the input grids and the output grids:\n\n"
            "1. **Expansion of Dimensions**: Each transformation results in an output "
            "grid with larger dimensions (typically 3 times wider and taller in the "
            "examples shown), indicating spatial expansion.\n\n"
            "2. **Color Retention**: The colors present in the input grids are "
            "maintained in the output grids; no new colors are introduced and each "
            "specific number corresponds to a predefined color.\n\n"
            "3. **Positional Changes**: The arrangement of colored squares often shifts "
            "dramatically; for instance, groups of colors in the input grid can "
            "appear segmented and rearranged in the output grid.\n\n"
            "4. **Zero Dominance**: The black color (represented by 0) occupies a "
            "significant portion of the output grids, serving as a background while "
            "colored elements are embedded within it to create patterns.\n\n"
            "5. **Regular Patterns**: Many output grids exhibit repetitive patterns "
            "or symmetrical placements of colors throughout the grid, suggesting a "
            "systematic transformation from the input structure.\n\n"
            "6. **Non-linear Distribution**: Transition from the input grids to output "
            "grids does not maintain linear uniformity; rather, colors can cluster "
            "together or create isolated patches that do not follow a straightforward "
            "distribution.\n\n"
            "7. **Selective Surety**: Some colored areas in the input grids are entirely "
            "omitted in the output grids, indicating a selective transformation where "
            "certain colors or positional instances are favored over others.\n\n"
            "8. **Frequency of Color**: In multiple transformations, certain colors "
            "appear more frequently in their respective output grids compared to "
            "others. This may suggest a prominence or emphasis on specific hues in "
            "the transformed designs.\n\n"
            "9. **Spatial Connectivity**: Some colored regions maintain relative "
            "proximity to their positions in the input grids, forming linked patterns "
            "like cross shapes or vertical columns in the output grids.\n\n"
            "10. **Transformation Complexity**: The transformations often exhibit "
            "complexity in shape; for example, the distinct color patterns within the "
            "output grid generate a visual discontinuity relative to the relatively "
            "simple input shapes, indicating more intricate design transformations."

        "observations_to_generate": 10,
        "observation": (
            "Here are 10 observations based on the provided transformations between "
            "the input grids and the output grids:\n\n"
            "1. **Grid Dimensions**: Both the input and output grids maintain the same dimensions "
            "in each transformation pair, ensuring that the transformation rules are applied "
            "within a consistent spatial framework.\n\n"
            "2. **Color Consistency**: The set of colors used in the input grids is consistent "
            "with those in the output grids. No new colors are introduced in the transformation "
            "process, which suggests that transformations are restricted to reconfigurations "
            "of existing states (colors).\n\n"
            "3. **Preservation of Cell Count**: The total number of cells remains constant from "
            "input to output, indicating that the transformations involve altering the state of "
            "cells rather than adding or removing them.\n\n"
            "4. **Recurrent Colors**: Specific colors (like blue, yellow, red) appear repeatedly "
            "across different transformation scenarios, hinting at standardized roles or "
            "functions for these colors within the transformation rules.\n\n"
            "5. **Symmetry and Patterns**: There is a visible tendency towards creating symmetrical "
            "or patterned arrangements in the output grids, suggesting that the transformation "
            "rules may prioritize or result in organized structures.\n\n"
            "6. **Boundary Integrity**: The boundaries of the grid are unchanged, with "
            "transformations occurring internally without expanding or contracting the grid's "
            "external dimensions.\n\n"
            "7. **No Isolation of Colors**: Colors in the output grids are generally connected "
            "to each other or to cells of the same color, indicating that isolated cells of a "
            "particular color in the output are rare, which may suggest rules about continuity "
            "or clustering.\n\n"
            "8. **Localized Intensity Changes**: While the placement and perhaps intensity of "
            "colors change, the specific regions where colors appear in the input often correlate "
            "with where changes occur in the output, suggesting that initial configurations heavily "
            "influence final outcomes.\n\n"
            "9. **Balance of Color Distribution**: The output grids seem to balance the distribution "
            "of colors more evenly compared to the input grids, perhaps to achieve a more stable "
            "or harmonious state according to the transformation rules.\n\n"
            "10. **Visible Transformation Pathways**: The transformations generally show a "
            "progression or pathway of change, such as a blue cell influencing its immediate "
            "neighbors, which then might transform into red or yellow. This stepwise change "
            "implies a rule set that might mimic diffusion or influence spreading from a point "
            "of origin."
