            "1. **Duplication Analysis**: The transformation replicates the entire input grid exactly "
            "within the output grid. Specifically, the duplication occurs in such a way that each "
            "colored cell in the input corresponds to a full 3x3 subgrid in the output where the "
            "entire input grid is replicated.\n\n"
            "2. **Scaling Regions**: The input grid is duplicated without any alteration in size, "
            "maintaining the original dimensions within the output grid.\n\n"
            "3. **Spatial Preservation**: The positions of the colored cells in the input grid dictate "
            "their respective placements in the output grid, thereby determining where the duplicated "
            "grids appear within the 9x9 output grid.\n\n"
            "4. **Pattern Distribution**: The duplication method is consistent across the output grid, "
            "where each subgrid either contains the full input grid or remains empty based on the "
            "input cell's coloration.\n\n"
            "5. **Scale Factor Mapping**: Given that the input grid's duplication retains its original size, "
            "there is no scaling factor involved in this transformation process.\n\n"
